# SchoolWork
This Repo contains some of my contributions to previous university projects.

The Networks folder contains some of my controbutions to a project where we had to develop a reliable communication network for a given node topology and the full project to show the codebase I was working with.

The GameOfLife file was an assignment for parallel computing. I was given the rules of John Conway's 'life' and had to create a CUDA application to run the simulation.
